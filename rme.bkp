What is it all about?
---------------------
The aim of the package is to compute different power indices of the so-called weighted voting systems (games). This package was employed to perform calculations at powdist.com_

Players have weights and can form coalitions. A coalition that achieves the required threshold wins.  

Consider a system with two parties A and B having 51 and 49 seats respectively with a simple majority rule (i.e. the threshold is 51 seats).  
How much power do they have? It may appear that according to the number of the seats they have 51% and 49% respectively.
   
However, party A can impose any decision without cooperating with party B.  

It leads to a conclusion that any reasonable rule would assign to party A 100% of the power (since it wins without cooperation) and to the party B 0% of the power and not 51% to 49%.  

The most popular approaches to measure power are Banzhaf_ and Shapley-Shubik_  power indices.  


How to use it
-------------

Let's implement an example from the introduction::

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	import powerindex as px
	game=px.Game(quota=51,weights=[51,49])

Now calculate Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik power indices::

	game.calc_banzhaf()
	print game.banzhaf
	>>> [1.0,0.0]
	game.calc_shapley_shubik()
	print game.shapley_shubik
	>>> [1.0,0.0]

Function calc() computes all available indices.  

Thus, in this simple example both indices give 100% to 0% distribution.

Now let's changes the seats distribution to the parity and see what happens::
 
	game=px.Game(51,weights=[50,50])
	game.calc()
	print game.banzhaf
	>>> [0.5,0.5]
	print game.shapley_shubik
	>>> [0.5,0.5]

As the result, the power distribution is also at parity.

Now, consider a non-trivial, but still simple examples from Wikipedia::

	game=px.Game(6,[4, 3, 2, 1])
	game.calc_banzhaf()
	print game.banzhaf
	>>> [0.4166666666666667, 0.25, 0.25, 0.08333333333333333]

Interpretation is simple. A committee where 4 parties hold 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of seats with required qualified majority of 60%, have 41.7%, 25%, 25%, 8.3% of power respectively.  

In this example, having 2 or 3 seats leads to the same level of power.  

Another example from Wikipedia::

	game=px.Game(6,[3, 2, 1, 1])
	game.calc_banzhaf()
	print game.banzhaf
	>>> [0.5, 0.16666666666666669, 0.16666666666666669, 0.16666666666666669]

Notice that in the previous two examples Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices coincides. It doesn't hold in general even in the games of 3 voters::

	game=px.Game(4,[3, 2, 1])
	game.calc() # again it calculates all available indices
	print game.banzhaf
	>>> [0.6,0.2,0.2]
	print game.shapley_shubik
	>>> [0.6666666666666667, 0.16666666666666669, 0.16666666666666669]

Thus, the level of power depends on how you measure it.


Plot the results
----------------------------------

** Plot as a pie chart **

There's a possibility to plot the power distribution as a pie chart::

	game=px.Game(4,[3, 2, 1])
	game.calc()
	game.pie_chart()

.. image:: https://github.com/maxlit/powerindex/raw/master/ex1.png

As you can see on the plot, the parties have numbers. In order, to put their names on the chart you need to work with Party class.  
Let's take Europen Economic Community (EEC) in the years 1958-1972, its members were Germany (4 votes), France (4 votes), Italy (4 votes), Belgium (2 votes), Netherlands (2 votes) and Luxembourg (1 vote) with qualified majority of 12 votes::

	countries={"Germany":4,"France":4,"Italy":4,"Belgium":2,"Netherlands":2,"Luxembourg":1}
	parties=[px.Party(countries[country],country) for country in countries]
	game=px.Game(12,parties=parties)
	game.calc()
	game.pie_chart()

.. image:: https://github.com/maxlit/powerindex/raw/master/ex2.png

As you can see both in Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik approach to measure power, Luxembourg has 0% of power.  

Install
-------

Depending on your favorite way to install python packages, run either::

	pip install powerindex

or::
	
	easy_install powerindex


On computation:
--------------
Usually the exact and fast computation of indices is based on enumeration methods implemented by dynamic programming given that the weights and thresholds are integers.  
For instance, the computation of Banzhaf is O(qn) hard and computation of Shapley-Shubik is O(qn^2) hard.  
If the input has non-integers, then an approximation scheme is usually involved. Consult the list of literature if you want to start exploring the topic by yourself.
